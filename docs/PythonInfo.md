# Python Environment

Creating a Conda environment provides an isolated workspace for your project, ensuring that the libraries for different projects don't interfere with each other. This can be very helpful when different projects require different versions of the same library.

`pip install -r requirements.txt` is a standard way to ensure that all necessary Python dependencies are installed correctly. Even though you might have used Conda to manage your environments, you're still likely using pip as your package installer within those environments.

So, these two things serve different purposes and they can coexist perfectly:

- Use conda (or virtualenv, venv, etc.) to create isolated Python environments.
- Use pip to install Python packages within those environments.

By including a requirements.txt file in your repo, you are just making sure that whoever wants to reproduce your environment can do so easily by running one command, regardless of whether they use Conda or another tool to manage their environments.

Here's how you would normally setup a new environment and install requirements from requirements.txt:

```bash
# Create a new conda environment

conda create --name myenv

# Activate the created environment

conda activate myenv

# Install packages from requirements.txt

pip install -r requirements.txt

# You can name 'myenv' whatever you'd like. ðŸ˜Š
```
