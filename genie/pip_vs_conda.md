How can i start a python environment for a jupyter notebook?

## Genie

Sure, here are the steps to set up a Python environment for Jupyter Notebook:

## Step 1: Install Anaconda

Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of Python and R programming languages. It simplifies package management and deployment.

If you haven't installed Anaconda, please follow the instructions on their [downloads page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#download-section).

## Step 2: Create a new conda environment

After installing Anaconda, open your terminal or command prompt and create a new conda environment using the following command:

```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.6
```

In this command, `myenv` can be replaced by the name you want to give to your new Python environment, and '3.6' should be replaced by the version of Python you want to use.

## Step 3: Activate the environment

You can now activate the environment you just created by running:

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

Replace 'myenv' with the name of your environment.

## Step 4: Install Jupyter

With your conda environment activated, install Jupyter notebook using the following command:

```bash
conda install jupyter
```

## Step 5: Start Jupyter Notebook

Once installation is complete, you can start Jupyter Notebook by running:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Jupyter should now be running and accessible via a browser at the URL: <http://localhost:8888>

Remember to replace 'myenv' with your environment's name in all the commands.

How can i ensure that package/dependency install information will be included in this repo?

## Genie

In Python, the common practice to ensure that package/dependency install information gets included in your repository is by creating a `requirements.txt` file. This file lists all the Python libraries that your project depends on.

Here's how you can generate this file:

## Step 1: Activate your environment

Activate the environment where you have installed your project's dependencies. You can do this using the command:

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

Replace 'myenv' with the name of your environment.

## Step 2: Generate the requirements.txt file

While inside your project directory, use this command to generate a `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This will create a `requirements.txt` file in your project directory, listing all the libraries in your environment along with their versions.

## Step 3: Committing the requirements.txt file

You should include this `requirements.txt` file in your Git repository. This will allow others to replicate your environment.

To add and commit the `requirements.txt` file in git:

```bash
git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Add requirements.txt"
```

## Installing from requirements.txt

When someone else clones your repository and wants to install all the dependencies in their own Python environment, they can run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

These steps ensure that all your dependency information gets included in the repository and can be used to recreate the same development environment elsewhere.

## You

is it strange for me to create a conda environment, but then ask the user to do a pip install -r requirements.txt to install their dependencies?

## Genie

No, it is not strange at all. In fact, it's quite a common practice in Python development.

Creating a Conda environment provides an isolated workspace for your project, ensuring that the libraries for different projects don't interfere with each other. This can be very helpful when different projects require different versions of the same library.

On the other hand, `pip install -r requirements.txt` is a standard way to ensure that all necessary Python dependencies are installed correctly. Even though you might have used Conda to manage your environments, you're still likely using pip as your package installer within those environments.

So, these two things serve different purposes and they can coexist perfectly:

- Use `conda` (or `virtualenv`, `venv`, etc.) to create isolated Python environments.
- Use `pip` to install Python packages within those environments.

By including a `requirements.txt` file in your repo, you are just making sure that whoever wants to reproduce your environment can do so easily by running one command, regardless of whether they use Conda or another tool to manage their environments.

Here's how you would normally setup a new environment and install requirements from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
# Create a new conda environment
conda create --name myenv

# Activate the created environment
conda activate myenv

# Install packages from requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: Replace 'myenv' with the name of your environment (you pick).
